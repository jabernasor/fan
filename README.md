# Fan Coding Assessment
In Java, implement a simple ceiling fan with these characteristics

* The unit has two pull cords:
    * One increases the speed each time it is pulled - there are three speed settings, and an "off"  (speed 0) setting. If the cord is pulled on speed 3, the fan returns to "off" setting. 
    * One reverses the direction of the fan at the current speed setting. Once the direction has been reversed, it remains reversed as we cycle through the speed settings, until reversed again.
* You can assume the unit is always powered (no wall switch).
